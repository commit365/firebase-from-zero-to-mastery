# Project Requirements for Capstone Project

## Overview

The Capstone Project serves as the culmination of your learning experience in this course. In this project, you will create a full-stack web application using a React TypeScript frontend and a Python Flask backend, integrated with various Firebase services. This document outlines the requirements and guidelines for the project, ensuring that you cover all necessary aspects of development, security, and user experience.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Application Functionality

Your application should implement the following core functionalities:

#### 1.1 User Authentication

- **Sign Up**: Users should be able to create an account using Firebase Authentication (email/password, Google, or other providers).
- **Login**: Users should be able to log in to their accounts.
- **Logout**: Implement a logout functionality that securely ends the user session.
- **User Profile Management**: Allow users to view and edit their profile information.

#### 1.2 Data Management

- **Firestore Integration**: Use Firestore as your database to store and manage user-generated content.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for at least one type of data (e.g., posts, comments, or user profiles).
- **Real-Time Updates**: Leverage Firestore's real-time capabilities to update the UI automatically when data changes.

#### 1.3 Notifications

- **Push Notifications**: Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send push notifications to users for important updates or alerts.
- **Notification Handling**: Implement functionality to display notifications in the app when they are received.

#### 1.4 Performance Monitoring

- **Firebase Performance Monitoring**: Set up Firebase Performance Monitoring to track key performance metrics, such as app startup time and network request latency.
- **Custom Traces**: Implement custom traces to measure specific user interactions or performance bottlenecks within your application.

### 2. User Interface

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the application is responsive and provides a seamless experience across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **User-Friendly Navigation**: Implement a clear and intuitive navigation structure to help users easily access different sections of the application.
- **Consistent Styling**: Use a consistent design language throughout the application, including colors, fonts, and button styles.

### 3. Security and Privacy

- **Firestore Security Rules**: Implement Firestore security rules to control access to your database. Ensure that users can only access their own data.
- **User Privacy**: Create a privacy policy that outlines how user data is collected, used, and shared. Obtain user consent for data collection where necessary.
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).

### 4. Documentation

- **Code Documentation**: Comment your code to explain key functionalities and logic. Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
- **User Guide**: Provide a user guide that explains how to use the application, including features, navigation, and any special instructions.
- **Technical Documentation**: Include technical documentation that outlines the architecture of your application, technologies used, and any third-party libraries or services integrated.

### 5. Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for critical components and functions in your application to ensure they work as expected.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the integration between the frontend and backend to ensure data flows correctly and that all functionalities work seamlessly.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Conduct user acceptance testing with a small group of users to gather feedback and identify any usability issues.

### 6. Deployment

- **Deployment to Firebase Hosting**: Deploy your React application to Firebase Hosting, ensuring that it is accessible via a public URL.
- **Deployment of Flask Backend**: Deploy your Flask backend to a cloud service (e.g., Google Cloud Run, Heroku) to handle API requests securely.
- **Custom Domain Setup**: If applicable, set up a custom domain for your application and ensure that SSL certificates are configured correctly.

## Submission Guidelines

- **Repository**: Create a GitHub repository for your project and ensure that all code, documentation, and assets are included.
- **Demo**: Provide a live demo link to your deployed application, along with instructions for accessing the application.
- **Presentation**: Prepare a brief presentation (5-10 minutes) to showcase your project, highlighting its features, architecture, and any challenges you faced during development.

## Conclusion

This project is an opportunity to apply the skills and knowledge you have gained throughout the course. By fulfilling these requirements, you will create a comprehensive application that demonstrates your ability to implement best practices, security measures, and advanced Firebase features. Good luck with your Capstone Project!
