# Common Security Issues in Firebase Applications

When developing applications with Firebase, it's essential to be aware of common security issues that may arise. This document outlines some prevalent security challenges and how to address them.

## 1. Insecure Firestore Security Rules

- **Issue**: Overly permissive security rules can expose your database to unauthorized access.
- **Solution**: Regularly review and tighten your Firestore security rules. Use the principle of least privilege to limit access.

## 2. Insecure API Endpoints

- **Issue**: Unprotected API endpoints can be exploited by malicious users.
- **Solution**: Use Firebase Authentication to secure your API endpoints and validate user permissions before processing requests.

## 3. Lack of Input Validation

- **Issue**: Failing to validate user input can lead to injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
- **Solution**: Implement input validation and sanitization on both the client and server sides.

## 4. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

- **Issue**: Without proper logging, it can be challenging to detect and respond to security incidents.
- **Solution**: Enable logging for security events and monitor access attempts. Use Firebase's built-in logging features for this purpose.

## 5. Data Exposure in Client-Side Code

- **Issue**: Sensitive information hardcoded in client-side code can be exposed to users.
- **Solution**: Avoid storing sensitive information in your frontend code. Use environment variables or secure storage solutions.

## 6. Unsecured Custom Domains

- **Issue**: Not securing custom domains can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Solution**: Ensure that SSL certificates are correctly configured for custom domains to enforce secure connections.
