# Firestore Data Model

Understanding the data model in Firestore is crucial for effectively managing and querying your data. Firestore uses a hierarchical data structure consisting of collections and documents.

## Key Concepts

### Collections

- A collection is a group of documents. Each collection can contain multiple documents, and collections can be nested within other collections.
- Collections are identified by their names, and each collection can contain documents with different structures.

### Documents

- A document is a set of key-value pairs. Each document is identified by a unique ID within its collection.
- Documents can contain various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and nested objects.

### Example Structure

```
users (collection)
  ├── userId1 (document)
  │     ├── name: "John Doe"
  │     ├── email: "john@example.com"
  │     └── age: 30
  ├── userId2 (document)
  │     ├── name: "Jane Smith"
  │     ├── email: "jane@example.com"
  │     └── age: 25
```

### Subcollections

- Firestore allows you to create subcollections within documents, enabling a more organized and hierarchical data structure.
- For example, you could have a `messages` subcollection within a `users` document to store messages sent by that user.

## Best Practices for Structuring Data

- **Denormalization**: Firestore is optimized for reads, so consider denormalizing your data to reduce the number of reads required.
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Use clear and descriptive names for collections and documents to make your data easier to understand and manage.
- **Limit Document Size**: Keep individual documents small (under 1 MB) to ensure efficient reads and writes.
